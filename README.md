# @, =, &

object property examples for directives with isolate scope in angularjs 1.x

--

The '@' operator extracts an attribute by name, and assigns it to the scope.

The '=' operator takes an object which it can bind to. The binding allows a template's 
input that is bound to the controller's $scope object to modify that object and vice versa.

The '&' operator allows you to invoke or evaluate an expression on the parent scope of 
whatever the directive is inside of.
